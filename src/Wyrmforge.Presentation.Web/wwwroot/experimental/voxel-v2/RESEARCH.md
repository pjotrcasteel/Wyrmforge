## Decisions supported so far

- **Adopt:** benchmark 16³ vs 32³; bulk edit and one authoritative writer; bounded snapshot/worker queue; revision-gated result acceptance; budget GPU uploads and explicit buffer disposal.
- **Adopt:** report p50/p95/p99 frame intervals and hitches; exclude hidden-tab pauses; distinguish CPU timings from optional GPU timer-query measurements.
- **Benchmark:** naive exposed faces vs greedy meshing under fragmented destruction, including vertex count, CPU build cost, GPU upload bytes, and latency.
- **Defer:** density-field marching cubes, LOD, octrees, and meshoptimizer integration until measured need.
- **Risk:** a full-site Pages artifact from an old cache can roll back production; deployment safety is a V2.0 gate.
- **Open question:** 10 cm experimental voxels vs existing 12.5 cm canon; owner approval required before integrating a changed gameplay contract.

### Batch 2 implications

- **Adopt:** Euclidean/floor chunk division and positive local modulo, one canonical neighborhood sampler, test exact boundaries and negative positions.
- **Adopt:** 3D DDA raycasting with tests for zero direction, tie boundaries, inside-solid origins, and maximum travel.
- **Adopt:** separate authoritative packed voxel data from CPU mesh outputs and renderer-owned GPU allocations.
- **Benchmark:** 16³ versus 32³ chunks, including update time, allocations, draw calls, and fragmented geometry.
- **Defer:** brickmap ray-marched renderer; the referenced prototype does not establish WebGL2 phone suitability.
- **Risk:** event-only mesh scheduling can strand dirty chunks; reconcile desired revisions against in-flight/completed mesh versions.
- **Evidence caveat:** mobile tile-based architecture guidance is not a Wyrmforge phone benchmark; published texture-upload numbers are not transferable across devices.

28. [Godot Voxel Tools development notes](https://voxel-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/development/) — prioritised worker tasks and background thread pool; implementation evidence, not a mobile benchmark.

[Godot Voxel Tools performance source](https://github.com/Zylann/godot_voxel/blob/master/doc/source/performance.md) — authoritative implementation discussion of unbounded snapshot accumulation, spatial locking, bulk edits, deferred GPU upload, and collider creation costs. **Same project as reference 4; distinct document, not an independent engine.**
30. [Godot thread-safe APIs](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/tutorials/performance/thread_safe_apis.html) — GPU operations can require synchronization and cause stalls; background CPU work is not equivalent to asynchronous GPU upload.
31. [Godot Voxel Tools changelog](https://voxel-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/changelog/) — shutdown and queued-destruction race fixes illustrate lifecycle hazards. **Same project as references 4, 5, 28 and 29.**

### Batch 3 conclusions

- **Adopt:** one writer; bound pending jobs AND snapshot bytes; reserve main-thread GPU upload budget; treat GPU resource deletion as budgeted work; bulk spatial edits rather than per-cell event emission.
- **Adopt:** each job carries chunk revision, sampled neighbor revisions, world-generation epoch and disposable buffer ownership. Accept mesh only when all versions match; discard stale outputs without altering voxel truth.
- **Adopt:** reset increments world epoch, stops accepting previous-epoch results, and drains/terminates workers with a documented timeout. Explicit tests for reset/exit with work queued.
- **Benchmark:** upload and deletion time independently of worker meshing time; collider work independently of rendering.
- **Do not overclaim:** the revision/epoch protocol is our proposed design response to documented races, not a design proven by the cited documentation. Mobile performance and safe concurrency remain unverified.
- **Source independence warning:** multiple references are documents from the same Godot Voxel Tools project. Count distinct documents separately, but do not represent them as independent implementations.

32. [Microsoft Azure Architecture Center: Event Sourcing](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/event-sourcing) — append-only event history, event versioning, optimistic concurrency, periodic snapshots and replay.
33. [Gaffer on Games: Fix Your Timestep!](https://gafferongames.com/post/fix_your_timestep/) — fixed-step accumulator, headroom, overload spiral, rendering decoupled from simulation.
34. [Gaffer on Games: Deterministic Lockstep](https://www.gafferongames.com/post/deterministic_lockstep/) — input ordering, RNG seeding, floating-point cross-platform caveats.
35. [Unity: Enhanced physics performance for smooth gameplay](https://unity.com/how-to/enhanced-physics-performance-smooth-gameplay) — fixed physics steps can multiply catch-up work after slow frames; platform-specific advice, general scheduling caution.
36. [GitHub Docs: Dependency caching](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflows-and-actions/dependency-caching) — cache visibility, branch scope, access modes and cache eviction.
37. [GitHub Docs: Workflow syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflows-and-actions/workflow-syntax) — concurrency and workflow cache configuration.
38. [GitHub Changelog: Read-only Actions cache for untrusted triggers](https://github.blog/changelog/2026-06-26-read-only-actions-cache-for-untrusted-triggers/) — trigger trust influences cache write permission.

### Batch 4 implications

- **Adopt:** immutable ordered accepted-edit log containing command ID, generator/schema/material version, integer voxel bounds, deterministic material/damage parameters, world epoch and resulting revision.
- **Adopt:** periodic versioned snapshots; restore snapshot then replay later accepted commands; verify canonical voxel-state hash against direct execution.
- **Adopt:** deduplicate IDs within an explicitly bounded session or persisted sequence window; replay applies accepted commands once and preserves order. Do not claim exactly-once delivery across arbitrary crashes without durable storage.
- **Adopt:** fixed-step player/physics simulation with a maximum catch-up budget; separate rendering cadence and voxel command ordering. Floating-point simulation cannot be assumed bitwise deterministic across mobile architectures.
- **Adopt:** workload reports distinguish frame time, simulation catch-up, commit latency, mesh latency, and GPU upload latency.
- **Investigate before V2.0 acceptance:** GitHub Pages cache visibility and freshness are distinct from deployment safety. Even an exact-main cache can be stale relative to a newly published deployment, and another deployment may race after checking main SHA. Require post-deploy production route checks and a single-owner publication strategy or isolated preview host.
- **Research methodology:** seven distinct references; two GitHub Docs pages are from the same publisher and two Gaffer articles from the same author. Distinct documents do not equal independent experimental validation.


## Research batch 5 — browser lifecycle, mobile input and memory (2026-11-09)

39. [MDN: WebGL context restored](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLCanvasElement/webglcontextrestored_event) — old GPU objects become invalid after restoration; rebuild resources.

46. [MDN: WebGL2 invalidateFramebuffer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL2RenderingContext/invalidateFramebuffer) — discard unused attachments; relevant to tile-based GPU memory bandwidth.
47. [MDN: WebGL getError](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGLRenderingContext/getError) — detect OUT_OF_MEMORY and CONTEXT_LOST_WEBGL without treating diagnostics as a zero-cost per-frame operation.

### Batch 5 implications

- **Adopt:** context-loss test mode; suspend GPU work on loss, preserve committed voxel truth, recreate GPU resources after restore, reject old renderer-epoch uploads.
- **Adopt:** explicit byte accounting for packed voxels, worker snapshots, CPU meshes and known GPU buffers; label GPU accounting as estimates. Do not require cross-origin isolation or Chromium-only memory APIs.
- **Adopt:** pointer capture and cancellation-safe gesture state machine, with tap versus orbit versus pinch disambiguation; verify interrupted pinch cannot trigger an accidental edit.
- **Benchmark:** mobile framebuffer formats, render-scale tiers, and selective attachment invalidation; do not assume a particular optimization helps without phone captures.
- **Caution:** all nine are distinct MDN documentation pages, **not nine independent publishers or experiments**. They document browser APIs; they do not establish Wyrmforge performance.


## Research batch 6 — continuous collision, editable compression and stress measurement (2026-11-09)

49. [Voxel Astra](https://github.com/fionnbanksg/voxel-astra) — independent browser voxel implementation with fixed-step physics, chunk-local updates and DDA; claims require device verification.

54. [VoxelRT experiments](https://github.com/dubiousconst282/VoxelRT) — comparison of brickmaps, DDA, distance fields and octrees with editing-cost caveats; author-specific benchmark.
55. [Geometry and Attribute Compression for Voxel Scenes](https://publications.graphics.tudelft.nl/papers/222) — palette compression and DAG separation of geometry/material attributes; not a mobile destruction benchmark.
56. [Chrome Long Animation Frames API](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/web-platform/long-animation-frames) — instrument long animation frames where supported; cross-browser fallback required.
57. [Random Access Segmentation Volume Compression](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cgf.70116) — random-access versus compression tradeoff; medical volume data, not directly comparable to terrain.

### Batch 6 implications

- **Benchmark:** swept AABB versus substepped per-axis AABB for diagonal movement, high-speed falls, tunneling, and cross-chunk collision. AABB is an initial broad-phase approximation to the proposed capsule, not proof of capsule fidelity.
- **Adopt:** collision reads committed voxels, never asynchronous render meshes; define whether unloaded/out-of-bounds space is solid, empty, or rejected.
- **Adopt:** sparse chunk map with empty/uniform encodings and packed mixed arrays as first editable storage baseline; compare alternatives on mutation throughput, memory and query latency.
- **Defer:** DAG/octree/brickmap renderer, WebGPU compute, and full GPU ray marching until actual WebGL2 mobile results justify them.
- **Measure:** p95/p99 animation frame intervals plus Chrome long-frame diagnostics when available; use cross-browser rAF deltas as baseline, explicitly excluding hidden-tab intervals.
- **Independence caution:** these are ten distinct source documents, not ten controlled comparative experiments; several are prototypes or implementations with different targets.

65. [GitHub Pages custom workflow publishing](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site) — site-wide artifact publishing and deployment-environment protection.
66. [MDN WebGL deleteRenderbuffer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGLRenderingContext/deleteRenderbuffer) — explicit framebuffer attachment cleanup.

### Batch 7 implications

- **Benchmark:** allocate/recreate chunk buffers versus pooled buffers with partial updates; compare CPU frame time, upload bytes, VRAM estimates and long-frame frequency. WebGL usage flags are hints, not measured performance guarantees.
- **Adopt:** renderer-owned explicit disposal of replaced vertex/index buffers and render targets; restoration recreates GPU resources from committed voxel truth.
- **Adopt:** never perform GPU readback in the frame-critical metrics path. Use available browser instrumentation for corroboration, not as cross-platform proof.
- **Change proposed deployment design:** prefer a single Pages deployment owner or isolated experiment host. Two independent full-site deployers remain unsafe even when both workflows share concurrency and cache keys; a cache is not an atomic view of the current deployed site.
- **Evidence limitation:** seven of nine references are MDN API documentation, not independent performance experiments.

## Remaining research

Target 75 distinct sources across storage, meshing, destruction, workers, mobile graphics, physics, persistence and deployment. **9 further distinct references remain**. Do not claim research gate complete before each is inspected and linked to a decision or rejection.

No device performance claims are supported by this desk research.
